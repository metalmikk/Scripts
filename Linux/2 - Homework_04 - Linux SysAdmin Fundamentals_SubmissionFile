### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):

    sudo adduser sara
    sudo adduser admin

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: 
    sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: 
    sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): 
    sudo usermod -aG engineers sam
    sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
    sudo usermod -aG engineers amy
    sudo usermod -aG engineers sara

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.
user
    - Command to create the shared folder: 
    sudo mkdir /home/engineers
    sudo groupadd Sharedengineers


4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
    sudo chown :Sharedengineers /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis:
sudo apt install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
man lynis

3. Command to run an audit:
lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output:


### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit:

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:

3. Command to run expert mode:

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
    - Screenshot of end of sample output:
